# here-is-my-theory-about-whats-going-on

u guys reach out to me about some position in early sep

theres some interview process

but u cant talk to me bc that shows bias or something

then i see u prolly like dec/jan/feb cuz of how slow things are

so that makes some sense to me

otherwise i dont get it

i def see u this year then, bc why would u stop interacting with this page, that's been going on since ~ nov/dec 2018 bc i use to check if the grad skools i applied to were checking my github and i think they were

i think u cant show bias or favoritism towards me i think that's wuts going on

if thats the case u then that means u cant show favoritism towards someone u'd be working with so that means i see u soon ... soooooooo thats wut this means
